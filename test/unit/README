When debugging unit tests it can be usefull to run the test_all binary directly.

If using valgrind, it is suggested to use the following options along with the suppresions file in this directory.
valgrind --max-stackframe=5000000 --error-exitcode=1 --track-origins=yes --suppressions=valgrind.suppressions

Note valgrind *hates* ifort, you'll get lots of fortran errors if you use that. If you are going to use valgrind, you should used gfortran-4.5 rather than ifort.

Useful options to test_all are:
* --log_level=test_suite - Show each test suite as it is entered and exits
* --run_test=<pattern> - Match a specific set of tests using a pattern
* --show_progress - When not doing test_suite show a progress bar

More information can be found in the Boost Unit Test documentation.
