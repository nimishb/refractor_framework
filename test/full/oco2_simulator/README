This test is based on OCO-2 simulator data. This is a single sounding which
was run in with a bunch of diagnostic information printed out. The data
is based on r60 data, and the run is b7. The original data was found
at /ingest/oco2-sim/OCO2_orbit_simulations/r60/01a/nadir/20100909_252,
with a scene file of OCO2_scene_NDa_20100909_252_r60CSUSim01a_012.hdf
and metereology input of 
OCO2_meteorology_NDa_20100909_252_r60CSUSim01a_012.hdf.  The meteorology
has similar content to our OCO-2 ECMWF files, but is in a different format.
We can read this in Level 2 by using a special version of the ECMWF class
(handled by the lua config).

The result of the simulator run provides us with Level 1b data. This was
originally at /scratch2/algorithm/OCO2_orbit_simulations/r60/01b7.

The files for for a full orbit. To reduce the file size that we need to
check into subversion, we have subsetted the data. The subsetted data along
with the script to use to subset it can be found in the input directory.

We try to set up Level 2 to exactly match the configuration used in the
simulator. We then use python to calculate the forward model and compare 
the high resolution spectra, solar spectrum, and low resolution spectra.

If we had everything perfectly matched between the Level 2 forward model
and OCO-2 simulator this would exactly match.

The diagnostic output from the simulator is in the directory 
simulator_result.
