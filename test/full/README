This directory is for tests that are regularly run, but that are a higher
level than the unit tests.

To add a new test, create a directory containing executable files
run_test and clean_test. Then add the directory to test.list to the list of
tests. See the sample "sample" for an example of this.

It is common to make some well understood change that will modify all the
expected results (e.g., change the absco tables used). There is a target
"make update_tests" that runs all the tests, and uses the resulting data
to update the expected results. Obviously you should be careful when doing
this, that an incorrect file is not accepted as the new "valid results".
