--- Note that the use of base_config.lua is entirely optional.
--- There is a small number of global variables that you
--- need to create, you can do this however you want.
---
--- The variables are:
--- logger - A LogImp
--- forward_model - A ForwardModel
--- solver - A ConnorSolver
--- initial_guess - A InitialGuess
--- number_pressure_level - Integer giving the number of pressure 
---    levels. This is used to size the output file, so it should
---    be the maximim pressure
--- number_aerosol - Integer giving number of Aerosol particles. 
---    Can be 0. This is used to size the output file.
--- number_band - Integer giving number of spectral bands.
--- iteration_output - Boolean. True if we should write out iteration
---   output
--- register_output - A VectorRegisterOutput giving the
---   list of output that should be generated. This list can empty if
---   no output is desired.
