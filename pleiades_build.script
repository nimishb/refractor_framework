Usage $0 [options] <install directory> <absco directory> <merra directory>

This is used to build the Level 2 executable on Pleiades. Note that you need
to supply a "install" directory. This *must* be on one of the NFS systems
(e.g., you home directory). You should not have an executable run from the Lustre
file system (e.g. /nobackup). You can see the Pleiades documentation for a discussion
of this (http://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/Lustre-Best-Practices_226.html),
but the summary is that they've encounted problems with executables on Lustre and
recommend that you don't run from there.

It is perfectly ok, and even recommended, to have the source and build on the
Lustre filesystem.

Because we aren't on the scf-srv machines, we also don't know where the absco
data is. You need to supply a top directory for this. Note that we need several
versions. Currently (B3.4) we use 3.3.0, v4.1.1_rescaled, and whatever version
we are currently running with (v5.0.0). This can be copied from the
scf-srv system at jpl from the base directory /groups/algorith/l2_fp/absco.

Note that the absco data should be on the Lustre system (e.g., /nobackup)

OPTIONS:
   -h Show this message

   -k Normally we strip out debugging symbols to rduce the space of
      the install. This option keeps them. The code is still compiled
      optimized, it just has the debugging symbols still available.

   -t Include running tests
